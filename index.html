    </header>

    Welcome on this memorandum (better know as a memo). Feel free to waste your time reading this unstructured non-sense,
    but as warning I will tell you this: If you are searching something, you are probably on the wrong website.
    If you are in need of something usefull, this is probably no the good website either. If you are trying to do something
    productive, turn back now. For those of you that remain: have fun reading this random giberish.

    <h3>Credits</h3>
    The idea and the layout came from some random genius on the internet. Impossible to find him, I would say, except when searching
    for a cmus guide aparently. If you want to take a look, here is a link to his 
    <a href="https://www.increasinglyadequate.com/">increasingly adequate website"</a>
